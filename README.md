I am a 15-year-old developer with four years of experience in software development, beginning with a strong foundation in web development and now specializing in Deep Learning. My current focus lies in natural language processing (NLP), with a particular emphasis on understanding, implementing, and optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs).

With experience in backend technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, JWT, Redis, and MongoDB, along with proficiency in front-end frameworks, I possess a well-rounded technical skill set. However, my primary pursuit is the in-depth study of deep learning and machine learning theory, particularly in neural networks, optimization techniques, and model architectures. I am committed to both the theoretical and practical aspects of AI, constantly refining my expertise in LLMs, transformers, and advanced Deep Learning paradigms, while actively developing and deploying Machine Learning solutions.
